           <h3> leet code Sunday! </h3>
           <a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-mountain-in-array/"> Longest Mountain in Array</a>
           I do not leetcode very often, I am more into making some tools and games that I use.<br>
           Anyhow, I love solving puzzles and  I try to find and solve one or two interesting question every week.<br>
           The problem I solved today was about finding a subarray with a particular pattern in an array.<br>
           I did not want to go a whole array for each element in an array to find the "mountain array".
           It seemed like wasting because it visited the same elements over and over again.
           It took me some time coming with a decent solution which I myself was satisfied with. <br>
           But when I solved it finally at almost midnight on Sunday, it was very rewarding :) <br>
