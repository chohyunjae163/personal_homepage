           Recently,I read a book about the technology of video games in 70's and 80's. <br />
           The first chapter of the book describes the big event in game industry 1971, "Computer Space". <br />
           I read about this &quot;Computer Space&quot; arcade game, and I thought it was really cool.<br />
           So, I thought it would be fun to make one similar to this classic arcade game. <br />
           It is a simple game which a player controls a spacecraft in order to avoid ufos' attacks and destroy them. <br />
           The tools I have used are the following:
       </p>
       <ul>
         <li>Pixel Studio - for pixel art. created spacecrafts and background images.</li>
         <li>Novation Launchkey Mini and Abelton Live Lite - for sound effects. made a small missile shooting sound effect when a player presses a spacebar</li>
         <li>Raylib Library - for coding. written in C.</li>
       </ul>
       <p>
         I have programmed some simeple programs before, <br /> 
         but it was my first experience to play with pixel arts and sound effects. <br />
         I enjoyed the process of making everything (sounds, art, code) by myself, <br />
         and the whole exeperience was satisfying, regardless of the final result. <br />
         I should have made an ambient music for the background of the game, and <br />
         taken more time on spacecrafts pixel art. They all look too flat. <br />
         For the next project, I will surely take much more time on code, because I want to 
         get better at programming, writing efficient and clear codes.<br />
