                this project took shorter than I thought.<br />
                I expected to be more difficult and <br /> 
                complicated than the last project (computer_space_war project).<br />
                I created bricks, ball, and player's bar with simple shapes (circles and rectangles).<br />
                I did not need to draw pixel art this time. However, I hit the wall at math. <br />
                The tricky part was to calculate the ball's angle when it hits a wall, the player's bar, or bricks.<br />
                At first, I tried to implement the reflection vector,<br />
                getting the normal vector of the hitted object, <br /> 
                the projected vector from the ball's vector to that normal vector, <br />
                and calculate the reflection vector from the vectors I have.<br />
                I searched google and watched youtubes on how to get the reflection vector. < br />

            <pre><code>
//assume the normal vector of all the bricks is (0,1)
//Vector2 brickNormal = { .x = 0.0f, .y = 1.0f};
// R = P +  2n(-PÂ·n)
//get a reflect vector. a collided ball 
//dot product
//float dot = -ballDir.x * brickNormal.x + -ballDir.y * brickNormal.y;
//Vector2 proj = {.x = brickNormal.x * dot, .y = brickNormal.y * dot};
//Vector2 reflect = {.x = ballDir.x +  2 * proj.x , .y = ballDir.y + 2 * proj.y };
//float length = sqrt(reflect.x * reflect.x + reflect.y * reflect.y);
//if(length &gt; 0.0f)
//{
//    reflect.x /= length;
//    reflect.y /= length;
//}

                The ball nicely reflected the way I wanted.<br />
                However, i realized that there is a much simpler solution. <br />
                Although calculating the reflection vector of the ball is clearly a generalized solution that can be used on any angle, <br />
                my game had simple normal vectors for the colliding objects. <br />
                Because the walls, the bricks, and the player's bar are not tilted, <br />
                I can just flip x-axis or y-axis value depending on where the ball hit.  <br />
                If the ball hit bricks or the player's bar, <br />
                I can just multiply negative one to y-axis so that the ball just changes its direction on y-axis. <br />
                If the ball hits the walls on the side, its directoin needs change only in x-axis. <br />
                No need to calculate dot product and square root of reflect vectors on every tick.<br />
            </p>
            <pre><code>
//check the side wall collisions
if(ballPos.x - ballRadius &lt;= leftWallBound || ballPos.x + ballRadius &gt;= rightWallBound)
{
   ballDir.x *= -1.0f;
}

                I learned projection and reflection vector for this project and how to implement them. <br />
                It was not easy. I had hard time understanding the dot product in geometric interpretation.<br />
                Frankly, I should study vectors and matrix ( linear algebra, therefore) <br /> 
                more deeply in order to apply the math to my game development in the future. <br />
