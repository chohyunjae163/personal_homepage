          <h2> UTF8 Encoding Decoding - Rosetta Code <h2>
						<p>
							I have encountered the word "UTF8" and "Unicode" time to time since I started programming. <br>
							I read about them on blogs and books <br>
							But, I never actually learned what it is.<br>
							Time went by, and recently ,a member in my C language study group suggested to implement UTF8 encoding and decoding <br>
							for a weekly assignment.<br> 
							Encoding a Unicode code point into UTF-8 and decoding UTF-8 encoded bytes <br>
							into a unicode really pushed me to learn how UTF-8 is working. <br>
							Also,reading about UTF-8 on Wikipedia actually helped me understand the implementations of UTF-8 encoding. <br>
