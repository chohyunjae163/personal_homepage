        <h2>Ray Marching...! What an interesting technique!</h2>
        Two days ago, I was binge-watching youtube videos all day, and <br> 
        an interesting thumbnail of one video clip caught my eyes. <br>
        The title was "Ray Marching, and making 3D Worlds with Math". <br>
        <iframe width="320" height="180" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BNZtUB7yhX4" title="Ray Marching, and making 3D Worlds with Math" frameborder="0" allow="encrypted-media;" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        The idea that triangles are not the building blocks of an object in 3D world was really fascinating.<br>
        I have always thought that a triangle is the foundation of all objects when drawing a 3d scene.<br>
        Meshes, Vertices, triangles and other stuff that I thought was mandatory for 3d game development are not required in Ray Marching. <br>
        All that is needed in Ray Marching is <em>a signed distance function</em> <br>
        to calculate a distance between my camera location and a location of an object.<br> 
        I am still very new to this technology and still try to grasp the idea, wishing one day I apply thie technique to my future projects.<br>
        Here are the resources that I bookmared for future references :
