          <h2>Visualize a Tree!</h2>
          Another Rosetta code task!<br>
          The task was simple. I have to visualize a data structure called tree.<br>
          It seemed simple. However, visualizing a tree on terminal was much harder than I thought. <br>
					I could not just print a data and '\n' because I have to check "sibling nodes" and print them out before going to the next line. <br>
					Also, As those sibling nodes have children, I have to print all the previous sibling edges <br>
					in order to avoid nodes overlapping each other.<br>
					a child from each sibling must have their own distinct line.<br>
					This task took me more time and effort than I thought, and this is the fun part of programming! <br>
					Happy Coding!<br>
