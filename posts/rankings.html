          <h2> A variety of ranking methods </h2>
          <p>
            I enjoy solving puzzles and tasks in Rosetta Code these days. <br>
            <center><a href="https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Rosetta_Code">Rosetta Code</a></center>
            It is not like other algorithm-solving websites such as Hackerrank or LeetCode.<br>
            Although it hardly provides test cases or a complete solution to a problem, <br>
            its "tasks" are more intriguing compared to others.  They make me to think <br>
            creatively and find fresh solutions. I learn not only how to solve specific algorithm problems, but also <br>
            get to have a chance to learn new knowledge such as a variety of ranking methods.<br>
            <center><a href="https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Ranking_methods"> Ranking Methods </a></center><br>
            By implementing ranking methods in C, I was impressed to know that there are several methods to calculate rankings.<br>
            <center><a href="https://github.com/chohyunjae163/CProgrammingAModernApproach/blob/main/rankings.c"> Ranking Methods </a></center><br>
            I often saw standard method and modified method on TV or Youtube.<br>
            Fractional ranking method was the most interesting one. I never saw a fractional ranking number in my entire life<br>
            The hardest part of the implementation was the ordinal ranking method because <br>
            I had to implement a feature for comparing two strings to figure out which is smaller or bigger .<br>
            At the end, I implemented the method, but the code was really messy, and <br>
            it is absolutely confusing for me to understand what it is doing even though I wrote it.<br>
	    Seriously need refactoring for readability!<br>
	    Happpy Coding :) <br>
