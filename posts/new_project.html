          <h2> a new project with Handmade Hero! </h2>

          <p>
            Year 2023 is right around the corner and the winter break has started!<br>
            For a next project, I will make a dungeon exploration video game on Windows.<br>
            I am not going to use Unreal, Unity, or Godot. Instead, I will start from scratch.<br>
            Also, I will use new tools such as 4coder for a text editor and RemedyBG for a debugger.<br>
            <a href=https://remedybg.itch.io/remedybg> RemedyBG</a><br>
            <a href=https://4coder.net/> 4coder</a><br>
            They are all from Handmade Networks and they are awesome! <br>
	    I absolutely love with their views and perspectives on programming and softwares.<br>
            RemedyBG is still in development, but I will give it a try. An IDE like Visual Studio <br>
            has all the packages and handles all the bothersome work for me.<br>
            However, I want to learn what is going on underneath the complex IDE.<br>
            Learn and appreciate what kind of work IDEs are actually doing for me.<br>
            I do not have a complete idea about what I would make for this project.<br>
            It could be like a roguelike dungeon game where a player finds a way out of the caves.<br>
