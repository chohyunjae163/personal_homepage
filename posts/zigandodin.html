           <p>
             Recently, I learned about c language alternatives, mainly zig and odin.Both of them look fascinating.<br>
             I first heard about zig on Youtube a few years ago, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4oYSByyRak&amp;t=815s">clip</a>. It was fascinating.<br>
             I did not know there are people who develop low-level, system programing languages these days <br>
             (&quot;all the modern languages&quot; that I heard were all the js languages or &quot;high level&quot; languges). <br> 
             Bcause I was interested in low-level programming and working closely with operating systems and hardwares ,the talk about this alternative C language seemed very attractive.<br>
             Odin, I found about that language while reading gingerBill's interesting articles. <a href="https://www.gingerbill.org/article/">gingerBill</a>. <br>
             I love to read his articles about programming and got interested in a language called odin on which he is working.  <br> 
             I decided to give odin a try for my next toy project (minesweeper clone) because it has full support for all the major graphics API such as Vulkan, OpenGL, Direct3D, and Metal.<br />
             Also, the language is said to be &quot;data-oriented&quot; and the author says one of the principles of the language is &quot;joy of programming&quot; about which I care the most. <br>
             Nonetheless, compare to to other popular languages, there is not much resource so I have to dig the language deeply by myself.<br>
