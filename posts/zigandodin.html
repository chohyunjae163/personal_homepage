<h2>odin! minesweeper-clone</h2>
<p>Recently, I learned about c language alternatives, zig and odin. Both of them look fascinating. I first heard about zig on Youtube a few years ago, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4oYSByyRak&amp;t=815s">clip</a>. It was fascinating. I did not know there are people who develop low-level, system programing languages these days (&quot;modern languages&quot; that I heard were all the js languages or &quot;high level&quot; languges). Because I was interested in low-level programming, working closely with operating systems and hardwares ,the talk about this alternative C language seemed very attractive.<br />
Odin, I found about that language while reading gingerBill's interesting articles. <a href="https://www.gingerbill.org/article/">gingerBill</a>. I loved to read his articles about programming and got interested in a language called odin on which he is working.
I decided to give odin a try for my next toy project (minesweeper clone) because it has full support for all the major graphics API such as Vulkan, OpenGL, Direct3D, and Metal.<br />
Also, the language is said to be &quot;data-oriented&quot; and the author says one of the principles of the language is &quot;joy of programming&quot; about which I care the most. Nonetheless, compare to to other popular languages, there is not much resource so I have to dig the language deeply by myself.</p>
