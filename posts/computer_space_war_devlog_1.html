        <h2>back to the basic</h2>
        <p>I was coding a &quot;computer space&quot;- like game, and one day I found something unusual. </p>
	<p>my spacecraft should be at a position &quot; 250 , 250 &quot; near top left corner of the window when the game starts.</p>
	    
        <p><img src="../images/spaceship_no_problem.png" alt="Image" title="spaceship_no_problem" width="250" height="250" /></p>
        <p>However, it was nowhere to be fonud. Looking through my code and executing my game for several times, </p>
	<p>the spacecraft was positioned at bottom left of the screen.</p>
        <p><img src="../images/spaceship_error.png" alt="Image" title="error" width="250" height="250" /></p>
        <p>immediately , I recalled that the position of the player spacecraft was updated every frame, </p>
	<p>so it must have something to do with this weird behaviour. </p>
	<p>I commented out the updating part of the code, and the spacecraft was at (250, 250) again, back to normal.</p>

	<div class="code">
		<pre><code>
    //update player_ship positions
    float radian = (-45.0f + player_ship.rotation) * 3.141592f / 180.0f;
    //player_ship.position.x += (player_ship.power * (cos(radian) + sin(radian)) * GetFrameTime());
    if(player_ship.position.x &gt; SCREEN_WIDTH)
    {
        player_ship.position.x  = 0.0f;
    }
    else if( player_ship.position.x &lt; 0.0f)
    {
        player_ship.position.x = SCREEN_WIDTH;
    }
    //player_ship.position.y += (player_ship.power * (sin(radian) - cos (radian)) * GetFrameTime());
    if(player_ship.position.y &gt; SCREEN_HEIGHT)
    {
        player_ship.position.y = 0.0f;
    }
    else if(player_ship.position.y &lt; 0.0f)
    {
        player_ship.position.y = SCREEN_HEIGHT;
    }
    		</code></pre>
        </div>
	    
        <p>Reading the spacecraft position updating line of the code,</p>
	<p>I found that <code>player_ship.power</code> had a ridiculous value and</p>
        <p>that was what made the location messed up. </p>
	<p>I assumed that I could find something at the initialization of <code>player_ship</code> and I did.</p>
        <p>I forgot to initialize the power variable to zero as I should have been.</p>
        <div class="code">
            <pre><code>
    struct SpaceCraft player_ship;
    //this line was missing.
    //player_ship.power = 0.0f;
    player_ship.position.x = 250;
    player_ship.position.y = 250;
    player_ship.state = ALIVE;
    player_ship.rotation = 0.0f;
    player_ship.fuel = 100.0f;  
    player_ship.collision_radius = 25.0f;
    </code></pre>
        </div>
        <p>After set its value to zero, my spacecraft worked well. </p>
	<p>But then, several doubts came to my mind. </p>
	<p>&quot;why now?&quot;.</p>
	<p>&quot;How was this working all fine before?&quot; </p>
	<p>&quot;Was it was just luck that the value of power was begin zero all the time?&quot; </p>
	<p>I looked at my code again and discovered that I added <code>char DebugBuffer[2]</code> for a debugging purpose. </p>
	<p>I assumed that it might have something to do with the value of <code>player_ship power</code>.</p>
        <div class="code">
            <pre><code>    
    char RemainTimeBuffer[15] = { 0 };
    char DebugBuffer[2];
    
    struct SpaceCraft player_ship;
    player_ship.power = 0.0f,
    player_ship.position.x = 250;
    player_ship.position.y = 250;
    player_ship.state = ALIVE;
    player_ship.rotation = 0.0f;
    player_ship.fuel = 100.0f;  
    player_ship.collision_radius = 25.0f;
            </code></pre>
        </div>
        <p> Surprisingly, when I changed the size of <code>DebugBuffer</code> to 10 or 12, the position of the spacecraft was all normal again. </p>
	<p> (It was at the position (250,250) when the game starts). I experimented with different sizes and </p>
        <p> I found that the value of <code>player_ship.power</code> became garbage when the size of DebugBuffer was between 2 to 5. </p>
	<p> Otherwise, the value of the power was zero.</p>
        <p> This was weird. the size of an array variable seems to be affecting next variable's value. </p>
        <p> I speculated that the memory space of two variables ( <code>DebugBuffer</code> and <code>player_ship.power</code> ) </p>
        <p> might overlap because maybe the memory is not allocated when the variable is declared? </p>
        <p> To find out, I went to StackOverflow and did some research on when the memory is stored for a variable in C.</p>
        <blockquote>
		<em>
		<p>Nothing in the standard mandates that there is a stack. </p>
		<p>And nothing in the standard mandates that a local variable needs memory allocated for it. </p>
		<p>The variable could be placed in a register, </p>
		<p>or even removed altogether as an optimization.</p>

		- Does variable declaration mean memory allocation? - Stack Overflow - </a></p>		
		</em>
        </blockquote>
	<br>
        <p>To look for more official documentation. I downloaded C99 Spec PDF and read declaration part.</p>
	<br>
        <blockquote>
            	<p><em>
                <p>5 A declaration specifies the interpretation and attributes of a set of identifiers. </p>
		<p>A definition of an identifier is a declaration for that identifier that: </p>
		<p>— for an object, causes storage to be reserved for that object; —</p>
                <p>for a function, includes the function body;101) </p>
		<p>— for an enumeration constant or typedef name, </p>
		<p>is the (only) declaration of the identifier.</p>
		</em></p>
        </blockquote>
	<br>
	<p>and also opened the classic K&amp;R and found Declarations on page 210.</p>
	<br>
        <blockquote>
		<em>
		<p>Declarations specify the interpretation given to each identifier; </p>
		<p>they do not necessarily reserve storage associated with the identifier. </p>
		<p>Declarations that reserve storage are called definitions.</p>
		</em>
		<p><cite> - The C Programing Language</cite> by Brian W. Kernighan and Dennis M. Ritchie - </p>
	</blockquote>
        <br>
        <p>Indeed, declarations do not <em>necessarily</em> reserve memory space for a variable. </p>
	<p>Definition of that variable does. </p>
	<p>So, is it possible that the memory space of the two variables may overlap when they are only declared, but not defined? </p>
	<p>But then wait.. when does a declaration or a definition for a variable happens in C ? </p>
	<p>Is it the initialization? </p>
	<p>And I found this on GeeksforGeeks.</p>

        <blockquote>
		<em><p><strong>Declaration</strong> of a variable is for informing the compiler of the following information:  </p>
		<p>name of the variable, </p>
		<p>type of value it holds,  </p>
		<p>and the initial value if any it takes. i.e.,  </p>
		<p>declaration gives details about the properties of a variable. </p>
		<p>Whereas, <strong>Definition</strong> of a variable says where the variable gets stored. </p>
		<p>i.e., memory for the variable is allocated during the definition of the variable. </p>
		<p>In C language definition and declaration for a variable takes place at the same time.</em> </p>
	        <p>
            	<em><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-definition-and-declaration/">
		    - Difference between Definition and Declaration -</a></em>
        	</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>how stupid! I equated <em>definition</em> with <em>initialization</em>. </p>
	<p>I was thinking that declaration is a variable &quot;declaration&quot; without initializing it. </p>
	<p>In C language, declaration and definition for a variable happen at the same time.</p>
	
        <pre><code class="code">char DebugBuffer[2];</code></pre>
	
        <p>This variable is <em>declared and defined</em>.  </p>
	<p>So memory for it is allocated.  </p>
	<p>Thus, the memory of the array overlaps the memory of the next variable is not possible.  </p>
	<p>I realize how ridiculous that sounds as I write it lol.  </p>
	<p>If the variable is only declared using <code>extern</code> keyword, </p>
	<p>there is nothing to overlap in the first place because  </p>
	<p>there is no memory allocation for that declared-only variable. </p>
        <p>so then what? what is happening in my code? </p>
	<p>The value of player_ship.power changes when the size of the character array buffer changes.</p>
        <p>It turns out that the answer was simple. </p>
	<p>I was actually lucky not getting the garbage value before. </p>
	<p>the value could have been garbage anytime because I did not initialize it. </p>
	<p>Obvisouly, there was no guarantee that the value of power was zero all the time. </p>
	<p>Because the value of <code>player_ship.power</code> was zero most of the time,</p>
	<p>but had garbage value only when <code>DebugBuffer</code> 's size was from 2 to 5, </p>
	<p>I assumed that the size of that array must matter somehow.</p>
        <p>When using a struct, dont forget to initialize all the members! </p>
	<p>Or better, I will use <code>memset</code> from now on to ensure that </p>
	<p>the memory space allocated had no garbage, but the initial values that I set.</p>
        <div class="code">
            <pre><code class="language-C">    
    struct SpaceCraft player_ship;
    memset(&amp;player_ship,0,sizeof(struct SpaceCraft));
    player_ship.power = 0.0f,
    player_ship.position.x = 250;
    player_ship.position.y = 250;
    player_ship.state = ALIVE;
    player_ship.rotation = 0.0f;
    player_ship.fuel = 100.0f;  
    player_ship.collision_radius = 25.0f;
         </code></pre>
        </div>
        <p>After this incident, I realized that I never finished the K&amp;R.  </p>
	<p>I read it time to time here and there, but I never &quot;studied&quot; it,  </p>
	<p>focusing line by line and try to understand fully what it means.  </p>
	<p>I should make some time for reading too, not just using all my free time for creating a game. </p>

        <p>Happy Coding :)</p>
