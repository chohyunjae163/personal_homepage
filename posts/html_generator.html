<h2>html template generator using C language</h2>
<p>
  I am maintaining this blog by posting my devlogs.<br />
As I have been writing several posts in the last few weeks, I realized that they all share more or less similar html format.<br />
Espeically, the first part of the html describing the style and the headers and the last part after the content, closing the opened tags are almost always repetitive.<br />
Because I use mostly the same style (background and font) throughout all posts,
I figured that I might as well make a little program to generate
a html template to wrap the content of the post.<br />
This C program takes the content as input, and wraps that content with the html headers and closing tags.<br />
Therefore, I do not need to write the same html meta  and style tags every time I write the post. My program will do it for me.<br />
This html post itself is generated by the program.
