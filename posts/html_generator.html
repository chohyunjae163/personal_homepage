<h2>html template generator using C language</h2>
<p>
  I am maintaining this blog by posting my devlogs. <br />
  My writing process is as follows:
  <ol>
   <li> write a content of a post using a software called "ghostwriter" (a markdown editor) </li>
   <li> convert the markdown file to a html file using "ghostwriter" <a href"https://invent.kde.org/office/ghostwriter">Ghostwriter</a> </li>
   <li> write html a head, meta and style tags to make a complete html5 file containing my writing. </li>
  </ol>
As I have been writing several posts in the last few weeks, <br />
I realized that they all share more or less similar html format.<br />
Espeically, the first part of the html, the style and the head tags, <br />
and the last html part (all those closing tags) after the content are almost always repetitive.<br />
Because I use mostly the same style (background and font) throughout all posts, <br />
I figured that I might as well make a little program to generate <br />
a html template to wrap the content of the post.<br />
This C program takes the content as input, and wraps that content with the html head part and closing tags.<br />
Therefore, I do not need to write the same html meta and style tags every time I write the post. My program will do it for me.<br />
This html post itself is in fact generated by the program. <br />
