          <h3> Configuring 4coder!</h3> 
          <p>
            I have been using a text editor called 4coder for my project lately.<br>
            IDEs like Visual Studio is certainly very convinient and has a lot of features.<br>
            However, because it does a lot of work (which is sometimes repetitive and bothersome) <br>
            under the hood, a novice programmer like me cannot learn <br>
            and experience the process of compilation and linking. <br>
            Thus, I like to use a text editor and a separate debugger instead and compile and debug myself.<br>
            4coder has been my favourite text editor so far, simple, minimalistic and performant.<br>
            <a href="https://4coder.net/">4coder</a><br>
            Also, 4coder is very customizable like emacs.<br>
            Because this editor can be programmed with its customization API in C/C++ , <br>
            I can read the customization layer code and alter the editor to my liking, although recompilation is necessary.<br>
            Working on my cave-hunter project today, I added a custom command for "auto-close parenthesis".<br>
            If I press a Shift+9, the editor adds two parenthesis and a space between. <br>
            This is a very tiny feature, but I needed this and felt great implementing a new custom command <br>
            to my favourite text editor.<br>
