           <h3>Sherlock and Anagrams!</h3>
           <a href="https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/sherlock-and-anagrams/problem"> Counting Sort</a><br>
           <p>
            This algorithm problem is about finding all the substring anagrams of a given string.<br>
            Everytime I encounter this kind of problem, matching substrings  in an array or in a string,<br>
            I tried to avoid nested loops as much as possible because it is difficult to write and read them,<br>
            not to mention a performance issue.<br> 
            Maybe hashing can help me stay way from complicated multiple loops? <br>
            My original plan was to calculate a unique value for each substring. Then I would just need to loop once <br>
            for calcuation of the unique value for each substring and use those unique values as indices of an array. <br>
            Then I will need another loop (but not nested) for examining the elements, <br>
            checking if a value of an element is more than one (which means it has an anagram).<br>
            Adding all those numbers of the elements should give me the total number of the substring anagrams of a given input.<br>
            My plan seemed rock solid.<br>
            However, it was not easy to calculate a unique value for a string. <br>
            Googling about how people handle anagrams, I came across an interesting method using prime numbers! <br>

			 <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_theorem_of_arithmetic"> Fundamental theorem of arithmetic </a></li>
		 </ol>
	    <br>
 	    This fundamental theorem of arithmetic seemd promising! <br>
	    It states that "every integer greater than 1 can be represented uniquely as a product of prime numbers"<br>
	    I focused on the word unique. From what I understood, I can assign each letter a different prime number and <br>
	    multiply the letters of a substring would give me a unique value!<br> 
	    This seemd perfect! <br>
            One big problem was that the result of the multiplications of the prime numbers could get ridiculously large. <br>
            If an input string is consisted of one hundred letters and they are all 'a's, it is still two to power of 100! <br>
            So at the end, I give up using hasing-like method in checking anagrams. <br> Instead, I decided to sort two strings
            and check whether they are equal. <br>
            To alphabetize a string, I used a sorting algorithm called counting sort.<br>

            Anyhow, surprisingly, my deep nested loops passed all the test cases lol. <br>
