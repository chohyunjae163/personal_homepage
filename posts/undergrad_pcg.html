          <h2>My Undergrad Paper</h2>
          <p>
          I am in my 4th year in college, so I had to write a paper to graduate. <br>
          My paper is about procedural content generation in games. Specifically, <br>
          it is about roguelike dungeon map generation. I searched various algorithms and <br>
          studied their use cases. Among many of them, <br>
          cellular automata, random walk, binary space partitioning, and
          simple room replacement are chosen for my paper. <br>
          I implemented each of them in C language (100%) and described how they can be used <br>
          in creating random maps in roguelike games. <br>
          I loved their simplicity and enjoyed the implementation part of them. <br>
          With a little bit of treaking parameter input here and there, I could make <br>
          different maps for various use cases.<br>
          Oh, and for the first time, I used the infamous "goto" statement in C lol.<br>
          I used the statement when I implemented simple room replacement algorithm.<br>
          I could have used "continue" statement instead of the goto. However, <br>
          since I started programming, I heard that the goto statement is bad because it <br>
          is the cause of spaghetti code, so I should always avoid it. <br>  
          But, I loved the idea of labeling in code and my code  was shorter than <br>
          100 lines. Also, I will not maintain this code anyway,so I decided to give it a try.  <br>
          I posted the simple room replacement code below to show how I used it.<br>
          Anyway, I am still waiting for the paper to be accepted...<br>
